I purchased this product because of the unbelievable discount on it (consequences of being cheap) and surely enough, the product delivered was in absolutely terrible condition. If that wasn't enough, I realized the product is a fake. The forgery is quite precise and can easily fool you.When i compared my new set to the set of the ear pods that came along with my iPhone, the difference was absolutely clear. I'm sure even a 5 year old would be able to point that out. I can't blame Flipkart ...

This item is a fake. I can clearly hear a scratching noise in the left ear. The plastic is breaking. I tried returning the item through the website. Believe the seller 'Mobilevala' rejected it and Flipkart supports Mobilevala's view. By the way I am a Flipkart First customer and this is the first time I complained of a fake in spite of me buying at least 8-10 orders from Flipkart in the last 6 months. To summarise, Mobilevala sold me a fake and Flipkart supports Mobilevala. I have written ag...

One word- AwesomeThe key thing about Apple's EarPods is that they're tolerable to use -- a major improvement over the uncomfortable fit (in ear) and abysmal (bad bass) audio quality of its predecessor and many others.For those people who have rated this product one star... seriously have you guys even had a chance to get hands on these?

The seller Bonfone has sent me a duplicate product.It did not have Apple packaging (a box in which Apple packs the container with a seal on it)It only had a plastic white box with no Apple logo.The quality was cheap as well.Flipkart cc said that they cannot replace the product as the seller has no more left(Out of stock)Seller sold a lot of such headphones through flipkart and still not banned in spite of numerous bad reviews.

I ordered the apple earphones from flipkart. The product delivered to me was defective and i asked for the replacement. Initially the replacement was cleared and i was given the date for the delivery but 2 days before delivery the shipment was cancelled without any prior intimation. Worst experience with the online shopping. will never recommend this vendor to anyone. If i can give a negative rating i would have done that but unfortunately i can't so i'm giving 1*.

If you think the quality of the pair of headphones you received is not what you were expecting then it is strongly recommended for you to read ahead.There is a good possibility that you have received the fake ones and to be sure, you can look for the following things and conclude if they are the original ones or not:-1. A few cm before the headphone jack, it should have something printed on the cord, something of the sort "Designed by Apple in California".2. The ear piece must be divided i...

The earphones came in an Apple box (not sure if thats fake too) with seal broken. I still thought I should try these out. However the sound quality is poor. When playing sounds which have good bass, the sound distorts. Even the quality of treble playback is bad. No way these are original headphones as I have used the original ones that came with my iPhone for a long time. One can easily spot the difference in the playback.

Please discontinue with this product as it is of very poor quality. I've returned it once because it didn't fit the phone socket. And the one that I'm using that was delivered two days back, has its plug cover dropping off, it rattles inside its casing and is shorter in length. Of course it is a copy, but it could still have been a good copy. Its not. Its a terrible product. Please discontinue this product Flipkart, its spoiling your brand image.
