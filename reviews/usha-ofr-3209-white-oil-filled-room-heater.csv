Great oil filled radiator. It takes a little time - like *all* oil-filled radiators - to heat up; but the warmth from this is more comforting than the dry heat coming out of the blower-type heaters, and the stinging heat from the halogen and other infrared heaters. Oil radiators heat up the entire room, but take a little time.This unit does not have any blower - so no dry heat. Very comfortable.

Heating is not up to the mark. Better go for Bajaj..that's even 1K cheaper than this.

This is a good room heater, but it will not instantly heat your room, you need to keep it on for whole day/night to maintain a nice temperature,Built quality is good, no such electrical faults or issues came after using it for 10 days for long time.
