A great product at such low price. Cheapest price of all 1.5 ton ACs. Cooling is decent from the product and is very energy efficient.

It automatically shuts down when the room is cooled and then resumes when the room temperature rises a bit. Noise level from the AC is there, but it wont disturb you at all. Its a product for those who want good cooling at lowest e...

I purchased this AC in almost 24k during some offer period. I am very satisfied with the cooling & power consumption. I can not guarantee but tube material seems copper, however I never found tube material mentioned anywhere whether in LG website or any other website. Noise level is as much as in other window ACs.

Rats found inside the AC unit while unpacked. Unit is scratched here and there inside by the rats.  The unit looks like unpacked earlier. The packing material used inside are broken and joined by wide cello-tapes.Installation people were horrible. They were not on time. Completely non-cooperative. Wasted my day.

Very noisy,This ac cools fast, consumes only 8 units overnight, but is noisy, my advise to customers, better spend more 8-9k and buy a split ac in same configuration
