This was my first purchase from Flipkart and I am TOTALLY satisfied with the product & the express delivery....and that too cash on delivery.....perfect.Just got my PS3 with Uncharted Dual pack and was pissed off with the gfx quality thanks to Sony shipping the PS3 with the av cable.Went on the net to search for HDMI and saw the prices varying wildly from Rs 500 to over Rs 3000.Same with the prices in Croma and other dealers.When I saw this cable at flipkart (with the glowing reviews for...

I have tracking for the lowest rates of the HDMI cables available in the market with a fair good quality. As soon as I received this product from Flipkart and I started using it with my TV..it really  put a big smile on my face.. This is a nice product with FULL HD support for the display transfer of 1080 quality from my Laptop to my Sony Full HD TV..

Before I write anything about this particular HDMI cable, let me inform all consumers who're looking to buy an HDMI cable to not be fooled by companies like Sony/Belkin who're selling it for over Rs. 1000. To put it simply, an HDMI cable is an HDMI cable IS an HDMI cable. Just because Sony or any other popular company makes one doesn't make it any better.Now, coming back to this product - the Red Gear HDMI cable is a high quality HDMI cable, no doubts about it. The wire has a nylon sleeve c...

Amazed with the quality.Also picture quality wise, i see no difference between this cable and  a grossly overproced cables by other brands . I use this on 46inch plasma tv and picture quality is amazing from a HD set top box as well as HDMI out from laptop transferring 1080p videos.Nylon sleeve on cable looks durable. very slippery.Only issue with this cable is that since its flat, it resists bending . The HDMI connecter head is really big. I had a hard time plugging it into HDMI port at b...

The cable got delivered within 72 hours. So no issues with Flipkart. The cable itself is of a very high quality and the nylon covering looks and feels very sturdy. The only thing i did not like was the metal socket on the cable that sticks out from my laptop. A simple, black socket would have been better. But if the HDMI socket is behind your laptop, then even that wouldn't be a problem, as it won't be in your sight :)Otherwise very good quality cable, simply plugs and plays, no issues. Dis...

I have around 6 HDMI cables at various price points and the build quality on this one is as good, if not better than the ones I've paid a lot more for. Technically speaking, it's a digital transfer cable, so either it works or it doesn't (just like your USB cables, a cheap cable will work just as well as a fancy one). However, I don't mind paying a bit more for cables with better quality connectors as well as cable quality as they last longer, especially if you reconnect them often, and I'm e...

I bought this couple of months back just to find out that the socket doesn't fit into the XBOX HDMI Port, its just too large! Since then It's been lying around. I then bought a Nitho HDMI cable which was less in price than this one, but it was worth every penny as it has full featured support for 3D as well.http://www.flipkart.com/nitho-gaming-hdmi-cable-2-meters/p/itmdyub5htj3pzbzAs a side note, the fact that this cable is flat makes it worse to handle, I personally like the rounded cabl...

Got this delivered in a day, full points to Flipkart for sending it this out so quickly and nicely packaged. To build quality is superior too. i got this to connect my htpc with my led. the quality of belt cable is nice and will prevent any damage due to forced bends that develop on cables.

After looking at all the available HDMI cables on Flipkart, I chose this one for my PS3. This one is not the cheapest, but is definitely worth the money. It works perfectly with the PS3, supports full 1080p HD graphics for games and movies. It can also be connected to other devices such as laptops, etc. The packaging for this product was beyond excellent, it came in a big box, which the product inside covered by multiple layers of bubble wrap.If you're looking for a good HDMI cable for your...
