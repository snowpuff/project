So, I bought this AC for my gym room which is almost 10x10. The cooling is very fast indeed. Just cools the room in 10 mins or so. In summer, and in Chennai of course where the temperature hovers around 40 C around 4 pm and also my gym room is built in terrace.Just a false ceiling and a GI roof sheet above the room. So when I enter the room in peak summer at around 5 pm, it would be terribly hot and the walls would be like the surface of a cooker. In that conditions, this AC just chills the ...

I wanted to buy a AC in my living room which can relief me from the hot summer. Every shop i went, the person there insisted me to buy 1.5 ton AC since my living room (120SQFT) was open with adjoining passage which further attach to the bedroom.and also i was told that cooling this big room will take time.but thank to this LG product and the Himalaya cooling technology with five star rating which makes my room cool even though the space is open with adjoin passage. It's really efficient and...

I was searching AC and see this on flipkart. I've trust on LG and also find good deal on flipkart and ordered. Its speedy delivery, on very next day before 12. Back support is also good. Except installation team. They are not came from LG. Flipkart tied up will local dealer separately for installation and service. Their neither installation is good nor they behave like professional. They charge little less (Rs. 1065/-) but don't go for this less price. I suggest, hire from the outside. Result...

Excellent delivery within 24 hours of ordering , in the suburb of Calcutta. A value for money product ( looks like they have increased the price in this week by 3.5k ). However I have done the installation from a local guy , so would not be able to comment on the quality of service by their installation agency. The machine is running well .  The high point is , during the peak season of hot summer , the regular retailers are asking for a premium on the MRP and not budging for any discount , t...

Had ordered LG 2 ton Himalayan Cool AC from FlipKart online in May 2015. Received delivery in scheduled time. Had to follow up with service engineer to get AC fitted on next day (Sunday). AC is working fine and gives sufficient cooling to my living room + dining. Fitting inside split unit with all pipes was a cumbersome task as the LG pipes with insulation become bulky to fit between the wall and the AC. But overall happy about this purchase & setup.

First things first, got the product delivered on time with good quality... Only problem was I did not like the way I was charged for installation and installation was not done in a professional manner (i.e. they kept dirty hands on my newly painted house and the hand marks look ugly on my wall)The thing I did not like is, Flipkart automatically arranged for unprofessional guys for installation and I think I would have opted for quality LG technicians.

It is my mistake I choose to buy AC online from Flipkart. They have Jeeves as customer support provider in Mumbai, may be of LG. If you keep everything ready they will just plug and start your AC. Just screwdrivers, no solution provider. My advice. DO NOT BUY AIR-CONDITIONER ONLINE ...

I am using it from last two week, cooling is good, noise inside the room is not much. but there is some voise came inside the indoor part while ac is running may be due to is\nsattation problem. Overall product is good.Installation team charged me 2000 rs. 1500 for installation and 500 rs for outdoor unit support stand. Himalaya cool is just a setting of your remote when you fan speed will be full and your temp setting will be at 16, nothing else. Temp limit is in between 16 to 30.

AC is really good and worth at 24000 Rs. But installation was a worst... Filpkart should change the vendor for installation or buyer should opt for installation from LG by calling the customer care. 5 star for Ac and 0 star for installation.Buy this ac but get it installed by Genuine LG service center.

Its been 3 months I am enjoying the cool LG 1 Ton 3 Star. Pros- Its cools the room quick and satisfactory- Simple to operate - Room temperature button- The outdoor unit releases less water compare to other ACs at my homeCons- Indoor unit is bit noisy but its manageable- Once restarted, some time I felt it doesn't retain the swing option chosen - The resolution of the display panel is bit low, though its well readable

First of all on time delivery by Flipkart. Price and product quality is good. I am using it from last few days and what i have observed till today, it has nice cooling and it also doesn't take much time to cool the room. I found it lowest power consuming AC but has nice cooling. Very good for 10*10 rooms. It doesn't have many functionality but those were not required to me. It is able to handle monsoon and sleep mode was enough for me .

The day i received the A.C, same day it got installed by LG in Pune. Very decent & neat installation. The installation person was very well trained and professional. He was having excellent understanding of product and ...

1) AC was delivered within committed timelines2) Packaging was done perfectly to ensure no damage to the equipment during shipment3) Order could be tracked on the website which was really helpful4) AC was in perfect condition and worked as per expectations once installed.Overall a very good (near perfect) experience considering that we asked for a delivery in Tier -2 City.

I have bought this AC from Flipkart, as compared to market i save around 2-3k on this product . LG service engineer installed it properly though they had trouble with 11th floor. Overall cooling of this product is good but noise is little bit more. If you are looking for proper fitting of outside unit i suggest to search for professional AC fitting guys rather than LG service engineer, they are good but are not equipped with proper tools for outside unit installation.Rest about 5 start bill...

The product arrived in time just as promised by fliipkart , the delivery people were also very helpful, The cooling feels nice on a 3rd floor apartment. The installation was fast and reliable from LG , would recommend any day. Although the indoor unit's plastic quality is not that good but worth the price paid. My room is a 11 x 11 ft room on top floor and it works perfectly.

We bought this AC on 16th April and it was delivered on the next day itself and the installation was done next day itself. The AC was really good and cooling was good for 12*10 room.The sound was very less and takes 15 minutes to cool the room to 25'c. Installation was extra cost and we need to buy the outlet stand extra cost.For flipkart i will give 9/10,For LG i will give 9/10.

The AC is the best one can get in this price range. Cools super fast and is super silent.Flipkart as usual delivered it right on time and in perfect condition.

OK, 4 stars for the product and 1 star for the installation.Flipkart mentions that installation would be done by a Service Engineer from LG. What awaits you is a shock, no personnel from LG turn up, instead two people from some multibrand service organization who have no clue how to manage the issue at hand turn up. They end up digging many parts of my wall in the crudest way possible. No groove cutter with them, can you believe that? Also no extension pipe for drain, no point pin to connec...

This is a review coming in after 3 months of regular use (usage per day being around 8 hours for a rainy day and 10-12 hours for a hot and humid day). Superb cooling, quick one at that, lower electricity bills(compared to 2 star or 3 star ACs) and special features of "Himalaya Cool", "Monsoon cool", "Energy saving" are the bonuses not to be missed. Quite satisfied with what I have got so far from the brand of LG (I am currently owning a 258l Refrigerator, an AC and a washing machine by the co...

It is been a long marathon following up with Flipkart Service, their escalation team and higher management. Nothing seems to be working as yet. I took this matter with Social media to highlight their ineffectiveness. None of my tweets on the issue of installation have any effect...

As usual Flipkart's service is awesome, delivered the product very next day. And also they scheduled installation with "Jeeves Consumer Services Private Limited (Bangalore)". This service center is number one cheater, they were asking for 2500 for the core cutting. I immediately felt it is too high (as I did core cutting for my samsung AC in just 1000 Rs), thus I called LG customer care, who did the installation within 24 hours and charged 1500 for the core cutting.I suggest not to go with ...

I don't know how this product is because I did not get a chance to use it. Flipkart delivered only the outdoor unit and totally forgot about the indoor unit and other stuff. After a gazillion followup calls, posts on FB and twitter and an email to the CEO, the issue was resolved and I got the indoor unit. Very poor service by Flipkart. I was very frustrated by the service provided by flipkart and they did not even make any kind of apology or a good gesture to keep a paying customer happy. N...

Be care full when you cancel orders on Flipkart if it is going to shipped by third party courier like GATI like in my case. These people dose not update status of shipment. This may lead to long waiting time for refund and receiving invoice without which installation is not possible.

In the initial installation , the fittings were not gas tight. Hence within a week, the AC effect was not there. When I complained to Flipkart, they asked the local LG Service centre to attend to it.

I've got the product installed by the flipkart team who charged me 1500 and broke my building pipe. A few months later when the AC ceased to cool, I registered aa complaint with LG. The LG Authorised Service Team said since I didn't get it installed by them, they can't honour the warranty added that the flipkart installation team had wrongly installed it and now the gas has leaked. LG is asking for the installation charges again. Flipkart keeps extending the date of resolving my complaint.
