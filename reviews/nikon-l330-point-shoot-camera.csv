It is a very nice product without any complicated controls and functions. Though you can still go into the menu and change the more finer settings, the preset functions are more than enough to click a nice well balanced picture. Flipkart service was very good and the freebies that came with the camera were also nice.

This camera is  handy and good for non professionals.Picture quality perfect.Zoom best.But this is battery consuming. I was using normal pencil batteries and while flash is on within three clicks battery is down.Without flash battery exhausted in 15 clicks.Hope there will be some solution to it.

Pros:Good zooming capabilities.Digital zoom is an added advantageExcellent image processingExcellent Auto mode which will help in detecting different scenes.20.2 Mega pixel at this price is good deal. Cons:AA batteries.Overall a good deal coz you will get a original charger + Pouch+8 GB memory card + two set of batteries.Total value for money.
